         <p>Since Weinreich’s Languages in Contact (1953), innumerable textbooks and handbooks, collected volumes, monographs, etc. have appeared, dealing with a wide variety of aspects of language contact from different vantage points and frameworks. Among the types of contact-induced change, those affecting the morphosyntax of one of the contact languages represent an as yet understudied field—certainly from a typological perspective—and are of particular interest for at least the following two reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>They illustrate that even typologically uncommon changes to very basic patterns of a language can result from contact (e.g. changes in morphosyntactic alignment). </li>
<li>They suggest that speakers of a contact-language index constructions with individual languages less strictly than we may assume intuitively. </li>
</ul>

<p>In many such studies, the languages in question are either well-attested historically (e.g. English and Norman French) and/or there are native speakers with or without contact-background to consult concerning the grammaticalisation status of a potentially contact-induced change (e.g. Spanish in the USA). </p>

<p>Yet, the situation is considerably less clear in contact situations where contact took place prior to first written attestation (e.g. Parthian and Armenian) or where documentation has been minimal until relatively recent times (Amazonian languages and languages of Papua New Guinea); where languages have no written tradition, but have influenced a written language (English and Romani; Lekoudesch and German); where languages are attested in different historical depth (Sanskrit and Dravidian); where contact-induced changes appear to be restricted in genre (Armenian and Greek); where dialects or varieties of the same language are involved (Greek dialects); or where translation may be involved (biblical Greek and Latin). To make things worse, it remains generally difficult to distinguish securely changes due or at least heavily influenced by language contact from those resulting from genetic inheritance, in particular where there is no ‘standard’ language. </p>

<p>This workshop aims to explore the problems of investigating contact-induced change in the morphosyntax in general, but with a particular focus on such historical or corpus languages and on the typology of the documents that attest them and of the changes themselves. Its main goals are twofold: </p>

<ul>
<li>to collect and present new data concerning contact-induced changes in the morphosyntax primarily of languages with attestation issues; </li>
<li>to compare and contrast the methodologies of investigating this type of change in such linguistic contexts. </li>
</ul>

<p>To achieve these goals, we invite submissions addressing the following questions or other questions in keeping with the general goals stated above: </p>

<ul>
<li>How can the analysis of historical (corpus) languages benefit from the theories and methods used in the description of contact in better-attested languages or dialects? </li>
<li>How can typology inform a finer-grained analysis of contact at the morphological and syntactic level? </li>
<li>What role, if any, do ‘markedness’/‘typological distance’ and genetic relatedness play in borrowing processes of morphosyntactic structures? </li>
<li>Do insights from recent scholarship allow us to revisit and improve on the explanation and analysis of established cases of (possible) language contact? </li>
<li>To what extent can new (typological) insights confirm our doubts concerning traditional ‘hierarchies of borrowability’? </li>
<li>Is it possible to establish a ‘typology of borrowing’, broadly defined, for contact-induced changes in morphosyntax? </li>
</ul>
