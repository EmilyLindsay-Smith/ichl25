        <p>In recent years, computational methods have moved from the fringe to the centre of historical linguistics. They now sit alongside well-established core methodologies such as philology, the comparative method, and corpus linguistics. These methods have become an essential part of historical linguists’ toolkit. They enable researchers to deal with the large amounts of data that are now becoming increasingly available in the form of web-accessible lexical, typological, and phonological databases (e.g., Greenhill et al. 2008, Dryer and Haspelmath 2013, Haynie and Bowern 2016, Bickel et al. 2017, Carling et al. 2017, 2018, Moran and McCloy 2019) and the soon to be released Lexibank, Grambank, Parabank, and Numeralbank. This deluge of data is way beyond the ability of any one person to process accurately in their head. The deluge is thus inevitably driving the demand for appropriate computational tools to process and analyze the wealth of freely available linguistic information. It also means that researchers and students of historical linguistic disciplines are now expected to attend courses to learn how these methodologies are conceived and used. </p>

<p>Computational methods have recently improved, not just in their accuracy and precision but also in their utility. Today computational methods are used to do far more than build dated language family trees. They have been used to aid in automatic cognate identification (List et al. 2017, Dellert et al. 2018), to test hypotheses about word-order evolution (Dunn et al. 2011), to compare the dynamics of lexical and grammatical evolution (Greenhill et al. 2017), to make rigorous inferences about homelands and migration patterns (phylogeography: Bouckaert et al. 2012, Grollemund et al. 2015, and Neureiteret al.2021), and in comparisons of linguistic, genetic and cultural evolution (Greenhill 2021, Matsumae et al. 2021). The list does not stop there. Phylogenetic methods have also been applied to reconstruct phonology (Blasi et al. 2019), morphosyntactic features (Carling and Cathcart 2021), and other typological aspects of language, such as numerals (Calude and Verkerk 2016) or number marking (Cathcart et al. 2021). Finally, computational methods have recently branched out from building phylogenetic trees to study areal impact (Cathcart et al. 2018), including borrowing and other contact-related phenomena (Miller et al. 2020). The proposed workshop will focus on recent advances and results in these areas.</p>
