<p>The OV-to-VO shift at the VP level is usually the manifestation of a more fundamental directionality change affecting various levels of grammar. Nevertheless, the concomitant restructuring usually does not mean a simple reversal from clause-final complementizers to clause-initial ones, from postpositions to prepositions, or from prenominal adjectives, genitives and relative clauses to postnominal ones. Some of the expected changes do not happen – e.g., the NP and PP are still head-final in Hungarian 1000 years after the OV-to-VO shift. The change leading to a directionality shift may consist of multiple steps, involving, among others, the evolution of new, head-initial functional layers, e.g., a DP layer for NPs, or a CP layer for finite subordinate clauses replacing non-finite subordination. The directionality change may take place via intermediate steps – e.g., the [TP C] to [C TP] change sometimes involves a stage with both an initial and a final complementizer, as attested in some of the Uralic languages. Changes attested at various levels of grammar may take place simultaneously, or may follow one another in a particular order.</p>

<p>Observations of these kinds raise several theoretically relevant questions, among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the driving force behind the changes accompanying the OV-to-VO shift?</li>
<li>Do head-final structures embedded in a head-initial VP or dominating a head-initial VP violate a formal principle? The Final-over-Final Condition of Biberauer et al. (2014, etc.) has been claimed to rule out a head-initial structure dominated by a head-final projection (within the same extended projection). It predicts directionality changes to procede in sentence structure in a top-down fashion. Do observed changes confirm this prediction?</li>
<li>Does uniform vs. mixed directionality interact with prosodic wellformedness principles? </li>
<li>Is uniform directionality more economical than mixed directionality from the point of view of generation and/or processing? </li>
<li>Can processing principles such as Minimize Domain (Hawkins 2014 etc.) account for the facts observed?</li>
<li>How do OV-turned-VO languages differ in their grammatical properties from other VO languages? Which OV-like properties are the hardest to reverse?</li>
</ul>
