        <p>We call for papers that lucidly present the rationale, assumptions, limitations and affordances of one or more new methods in historical linguistics, in terms that address well-established concerns of the discipline.</p>

        <p>Historical linguistics is witnessing a flurry of innovation that promises significant new advances. However, today’s novel methods are often highly specialized and can lie beyond the expertise of most historical linguists. If left unaddressed, this deficit of familiarity may jeopardize the uptake of new advances and hinder the field’s contribution to scientific review of novel work.</p>

        <p>Despite their technical details, most new methods will possess a rationale and essential logic that are perfectly comprehensible to the inquisitive historical linguist, provided that their communication is sympathetic to the audience. However, because these methods are young and often arose in other fields, the discipline of historical linguistics has not yet established a stock of trusted clarifications, addressed specifically to our field and its scientific concerns. This workshop will raise the profile of such work, highlighting its important, facilitating contribution to progress in the field. </p>

        <p>Presentations may advocate for a method or remain neutral, but must be critical and strive to increase the breadth of the historical linguistic audience which is capable of engaging with the methodology. Papers may examine case studies in order to convey ideas more effectively (though this is not a venue for announcing new results) and we welcome authors of previously published, technical works to take this opportunity to explain the hows, and especially the whys, of their study to a broader audience.</p>

        <p>Topics may include, but need not be limited to, methods concerned with: </p>

        <ul>
        <li>Population variation and change (e.g. Blythe & Croft 2012; Meakins et al. 2019)</li>
        <li>Typological feature evolution (Aston et al. 2012; Carling & Cathcart 2021; Macklin-Cordes et al. 2021)</li>
        <li>Diachronic typology (Dunn et al. 2011; Moran et al. 2021)</li>
        <li>Inference of family trees (Bouckaert et al. 2012; Kelly & Nicholls 2017; Chang et al. 2015)</li>
        <li>Inference of language contact (Cathcart et al. 2018; Verkerk 2019; Ranacher et al. 2021)</li>
        <li>General principles for sound inference (Roberts 2018; Roberts et al. 2020)</li>
        <li>Computational detection of cognates and correspondence sets (Bouchard-Côté et al. 2013; List et al. 2018)</li>
        <li>Evolutionary consequences of linguistic interactions (Ahern & Clark 2017; Carr et al. 2020)</li>
        <li>Studies of language change and evolution in the lab (Kirby et al. 2008; Culbertson et al. 2019)</li>
