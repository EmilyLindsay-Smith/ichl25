       <p>Among the key questions for the theory of language change formulated by Weinreich, Labov and Herzog in 1968, the ultimate challenge is the actuation problem:</p>

       <p>“Why do changes in a structural feature take place in a particular language at a given time, but not in other languages with the same feature, or in the same language at other times?” (Weinreich et al. 1968: 102)</p>

       <p>In spite of the advances in the field of historical linguistics since the ‘60s, it is fair to say, with Walkden (2017), that “the ‘actuation riddle’, if solvable at all, certainly has not yet been solved.”</p>

       <p>For any given historical change, the actuation problem is a problem of explanation and prediction. Why is this particular change occurring here and now? Given the here and now, what change is going to occur? A solution to these problems is difficult to achieve because of the intrinsic complexities of language and change. First, any specific changes may involve a multiplicity of causes (Joseph 2013). Second, there also exist external causes of language, which reflect the contiguities of history. Third, language is a complex-adaptive system (Van de Velde 2014) that can recruit a variety of resources to achieve a variety of communicative goals. This makes it hard to predict how such a system will respond to any new situation.</p>

       <p>However, over the past decades, conceptual and empirical developments have contributed to bringing solutions to the actuation problem within closer reach. Conceptually, substantial advances have been made in unifying external and internal perspectives on language change (Haspelmath 1999; Croft 2000; Schmid 2020). This includes more accurate models of change in contact situations (Thomason & Kaufmann 1988; Matras & Sakel 2007; Walkden 2017: 415-417). The relevant models also embrace probabilistic thinking, describing speakers’ choices in terms of likelihoods (Plunkett & Marchman 1993; Bod 2015). As such, a probabilistic approach to actuation also comes within reach. Empirically, efforts in worldwide language documentation and cross-linguistic comparison have offered a much firmer basis to recognize regularities of language change, such as grammaticalization (Hopper & Traugott 2003). Moreover, the discipline has seen a surge in the availability of usage-data, which open up to descriptions of change in much greater detail (Petré & Anthonissen 2020; De Smet 2016).</p>

       <p>The goal of this workshop is to persuade historical linguists that the actuation problem is not unassailable. To that end, we bring together researchers with different backgrounds and expertise – variationists, typologists, phonologists, and historical linguists – to jointly tackle the most basic question about language change. We invite empirically-driven reflections and case studies on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longitudinal historical analyses that tackle actuation by comparing languages/dialects/idiolects etc.</li>
<li>Typological, interactional, or experimental studies that investigate change in synchrony</li>
<li>Studies of extralinguistic factors representing language ecology, e.g. contact, demographic change, standardization etc.</li>
<li>Methodological reflections on how to solve the actuation problem: new types of data and analyses</li>
</ul>
