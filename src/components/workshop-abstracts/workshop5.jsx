        <p>While languages constitute an integral part of most primary and secondary school curricula, the same cannot be said of the study of language itself, i.e. linguistics, despite various initiatives. A different situation might be expected with Historical Linguistics, if language history truly is an important component in studying individual languages, ancient and modern. But is that so?</p>

<p>Regarding more traditional aspects of the field, ancient languages have always been part of ‘humanities’ even with recent scrutiny of alleged political connotations (Hock 2003). Moreover, the history of languages can reinforce linguistic ideologies, e.g. espousing national unity through unified, even if changeable, national languages. Such notions are not easily reconcilable with multi-cultural/multi-lingual societies that aspire to respect their members’ cultural and linguistic rights. Thus, the question arises: are those aspects of historical linguistics intrinsically related to such ‘traditional’, outdated linguistic ideas, or could (and should) they be approached differently? If so, is there a place for them in current school curricula?</p>

<p>Another dimension here is the possible integration into schools of more ‘modern’ approaches to language change. For instance, historical linguists recognize that ‘mistakes’ in L1 classes are often effectively a different — and dismissive — label for more complex phenomena reflecting change in progress. A potential ‘clash’ thus arises between well-established educational goals (e.g. instruction in language norms) and more descriptive, rather than corrective, modern linguistic attitudes towards change and variation. Furthermore, the theoretical study of language change could significantly enhance linguistic awareness, as it touches upon sociolinguistic issues such as variation and social networks, also offering insights into human cognition. Given that enhancing linguistic awareness seems to be a well-integrated part of the Languages curriculum in secondary education in some countries (Trousdale, 2010), one has to wonder whether historical linguistics and studying language change are given an appropriate place in such curricula.</p>

<p>This workshop aims at the overall question of whether historical linguistics can serve school curricula, examining:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li> What, if any, is the place of historical linguistics globally in initiatives aiming to raise linguistic awareness among students in secondary education? </li>
<li> Does the study of ancient languages at schools follow scientific results and novel linguistic perspectives found in current historical linguistics? Do old, ‘traditional’ ideas about languages survive?</li>
<li> Is the history of specific languages, where it survives, linguistically informed, or is it still more or less attached to political agendas?</li>
<li> Does an appreciation of language change gain ground against more corrective linguistic stances at schools? Should historical linguists be more concerned with the propagation of their scientific principles in schools?</li>
<li> In general, does (or can) historical linguistics contribute to the re-invention of language courses at schools along more scientific lines?</li>
</ol>
<p>We see this workshop as crucial to examining the health and relevance of historical linguistics as a subdiscipline within our broader field, addressing how historical linguistics can aid the well-informed dissemination of linguistic notions to the general public. Thus, the workshop offers the opportunity to reflect on the position of historical linguistics within our field at large.</p>
