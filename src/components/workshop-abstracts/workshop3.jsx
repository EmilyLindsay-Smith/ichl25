        <p>Clitics, roughly definable as unstressed words forming a prosodic unit with a preceding or following word, continue to challenge both synchronic and diachronic analysis, ranging from the question of word-hood and their prosodic features to their position on the scale of grammaticalisation from independent lexeme to affix.</p>

<p>The proposed workshop aims at investigating different possible paths of development in the emergence of derivational and inflectional morphology through different cliticisation processes from a diachronic typological perspective.</p>

<p>Lexical units (especially pronominal or adverbial elements but also nominal case forms and inflected verb forms) are prone to an evolution from an orthotone to a clitic stage and vice versa; cf. the evolution from orthotone adverbs to preverbs (and later prefixes) in Latin, e.g. <em>prō</em>- &lt; *<em>prō</em> (clitic) &lt;&lt; *<em>pró</em> (orthotone). The reverse development is visible in the ortho-tonisation of the reflexive clitic *<em>su̯e</em> in Greek: ἕ (<em>hé</em>) &lt; *<em>su̯é</em> (orthotone) &lt;&lt; *<em>su̯e</em> (clitic).</p>

<p>Clitics may ultimately pass through a process of univerbation and thus evolve into affixes, bringing about innovations in inflectional as well as derivational morphology.</p>

<p>Univerbation processes involving clitic elements can create single innovative inflectional forms: cf. the 2sg imperative medio-passive desinence of thematic verbal stems Sanskrit -<em>a-sva </em>&lt; *-<em>e-su̯e</em> &lt;&lt; -<em>e=su̯e</em> (comprising of the active form and the reflexive *<em>su̯e</em>). Besides, univerbation can also give rise to entirely novel grammatical categories, e.g. the medio-passive -sk-forms in North Germanic originating from a periphrastic construction.</p>

<p>Cliticisation is a key phenomenon in the development of inflection of many languages. On a large scale this can be seen in the history of the Australian languages, where cliticisation is a recurring phenomenon in the creation of inflectional marking (e.g. Baker &amp; Harvey 2020, Osgarby 2018). </p>

<p>Univerbation processes are not unidirectional. Univerbated elements can be decomposed following a change in prosodic status; e.g. the adverb French <em>très</em> decomposed from nominal compounds such as <em>très grand</em> &lt;&lt; <em>très-grand</em> (now obsolete) &lt; <em>*trāns-grandem.</em></p>

<p>Although recognised in numerous grammaticalisation studies, mechanisms that lead to changes in cases like those outlined above are still elusive, unclear regarding the detailed processes and developmental paths involved, and cannot be accounted for on a solely prosodic level but appear to involve a complex combination of phonological as well as morphological processes.</p>

<p><strong >Research questions and goals:</strong></p>

<p>We welcome further contributions to the workshop that address the topics outlined above from one (or more) of the following perspectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>case studies illuminating the outlined processes and unresolved questions,</li>
<li>reconstruction of the state of affairs of specific clitic elements or entire systemic groups of clitics in Proto-Indo-European and proto-languages of other families,</li>
<li>etymological studies of individual clitic elements,</li>
<li>phonological accounts of cliticisation focussing, e.g., on regular or (seemingly) irregular phonetic developments resulting from the clitic status of a given element,</li>
<li>typological and diachronic investigations including also non-Indo-European languages in order to improve our understanding of the processes described above.</li>
</ul>
