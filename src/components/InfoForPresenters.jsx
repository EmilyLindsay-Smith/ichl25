    <h1 id="site-top"> Information for Presenters </h1>
    <p>We are looking forward to welcoming you all to Oxford this summer. You should have received emails from us informing you whether your abstract has been accepted.</p>
    
    <h3>Presentation Length</h3>
    <p>For talks at ICHL25, you will have 20 minutes for your presentation and 5 minutes for questions.</p>
    
    <h3>Handouts</h3>
    
    <p>ICHL25 will be a <strong>paperless</strong> conference for both environmental reasons so we are not encouraging printed handouts, but if you require handouts please bring copies yourself.<p/>

    <h4>Computer Facilities for Projecting Handouts/Slides</h4>
      <p>You will be able to project your handout/presentation onto a screen in your room. Rooms have a windows PC as well as HDMI and VGA connectors for personal laptops.<br/>
      You can also bring your handout/presentation on a memory stick / flash drive/ USB to plug in.</p>

    <h4>Distribute Handouts/Posters to Conference Attendees Online</h4>
    If you would like your handout or poster distributed to conference attendees via this website, 
    please send it to <a href="mailto:emily.lindsay-smith@ling-phil.ox.ac.uk">emily.lindsay-smith@ling-phil.ox.ac.uk</a> by <strong>30th July</strong> following these instructions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>File Type: PDF only</li>
        <li>Email Subject Line: ICHL25 Handout</li>
        <li>Filename: ICHL25_presentation_PAPERID.pdf </li>
        <li>Find your PaperID number on the <a href="/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> page - search for your name and find your ID with the details of your presentation. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unless you follow these instructions, we cannot guarantee to be able to put your handout up on the website in time for the conference. </p>

    <h3>Posters</h3>
    <p>Posters will be displayed in plastic hollow frames. In order to fit your poster into these frames, note the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only DIN A0 PORTRAIT will fit<br/>Note as the poster slides into the frame, it is not possible to place multiple single DIN A4 pages into the frames (they would need to be glued on one DIN A0 sheet - which is not available on site). </li>
        <li>Paper is recommended; cloth posters can only be affixed with bluetac which is suboptimal</li>
        <li>Only bluetac can be used to affix posters to the frame</li>
        <li>No tape, no pins and no magnets can be used to affix your poster to the frame</li>
    </ul>
