    <p>COVID has unfortunately not disappeared and for everyoneâ€™s safety we need to continue to follow some safety measures.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>With regard to the rising infection rate of COVID, we advise participants to do a COVID (lateral flow/rapid antigen) test before attending each morning, even if you do not feel symptomatic.</li>
    <li>Please do not attend if you are positive or displaying symptoms of COVID-19 and believe you may be infectious to others, to avoid transmitting COVID to the other attendees.</li>
    <li>We encourage all attendees to wear masks, and will provide hand sanitiser at the entrance as well as some masks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We realise that you will need to take your masks off to eat and drink, but there are plenty of beautiful spaces outside in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, and several seating areas where you can take refreshments.</p>

    <p> Paper - please note that in order to keep registration costs as low as possible and reduce the conference's carbon footprint, we are not producing printed conference packs. All information and resources will be available on the conference website. We are also discouraging paper handouts for the same reason.</p>
