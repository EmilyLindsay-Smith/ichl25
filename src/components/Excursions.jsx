        <h1>Excursions and Social Events</h1>
       
<p>We hope you are looking forward to ICHL this summer. There are many wonderful places to visit within driving distance of Oxford, and we intend to book coaches for trips to explore some of them on Saturday 6th August. However, we realise that many of you might want to leave early, or to spend the day in Oxford; there will be events laid on in Oxford, and there will also be opportunities for excursions and visits on Wednesday afternoon â€“ more details on both of these to follow.</p>

In order to make it affordable, could we ask you to express an interest in one of the following options by 31st May 2022 via this form: https://forms.gle/W9hJHiiV7mYfJAT5A

We will organise coaches based on the level of interest, then open booking to you for these trips.
